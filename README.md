## 🔥LAB518: Multi-Agent Apps with Microsoft Agent Framework or LangGraph

### Session Description

Build a multi-agent application leveraging MCP (Model Context Protocol) with the Microsoft Agent Framework in C# or LangChain in Python, integrated with Azure Cosmos DB for scalable and high-performance data persistence and retrieval. Define agents, functions, and external service integrations, implement memory, state management, and semantic search using Azure Cosmos DB. By the end, you’ll have a robust AI agent system designed for real-world applications.

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, learners will be able to:

- Understand Microsoft Agent Framework and Extensions AI fundamentals and their integration with Azure OpenAI services.

- Design and build conversational agents with message processing, response handling, and context management.

- Implement Azure Cosmos DB integration for agent memory, state persistence, and chat history management.

- Develop semantic search and vector indexing solutions using Cosmos DB for intelligent agent retrieval and reasoning.

- Configure multi-agent coordination and orchestration, including routing, communication protocols, and handoff strategies.

- Integrate and test external MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to extend agent capabilities and tool interoperability.

### Source Code

You can either work through the exercises step by step or use the completed files to run the multi-agent application in a retail banking scenario.
#### Exercises:
Work through the exercises to build the application step by step:
- [LangGraph (Python)](https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/banking-multi-agent-workshop/blob/HOL_v2_AFandLangGraph/01_exercises/python/workshop/Module-0.md)
- [Agent Framework (C#)](https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/banking-multi-agent-workshop/blob/HOL_v2_AFandLangGraph/01_exercises/csharp/workshop/Module-0.md)
#### Completed Files
If you prefer to skip the exercises and run as demo directly:
- [LangGraph (Python)](https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/banking-multi-agent-workshop/blob/HOL_v2_AFandLangGraph/02_completed/python/langgraph/README.md)
- [Agent Framework (C#)](https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/banking-multi-agent-workshop/blob/HOL_v2_AFandLangGraph/02_completed/csharp/README.md)
